	<p>The game my partner and I picked for task 1 was battleship. We picked battleship because we were both familiar with the game and were quickly able to identify the necessary answers for the task.</p>

<div class="box">
<h1 >Answers </h1>
<h3> What actions can I take?</h3>
<p>
 <li>Arrange your own 5 ships on a 10x10 grid, and leave them for the remainder of the game.</li>
 <li>Attempt to sink an opponent's ship by calling out squares where you think the enemy's ships are hiding.</li>
 <li>Fire a bomb at a ship.</li>
<h3 >What do I need to remember to keep track of?</h3>
 <li>Where you have already hit a boat.</li>
 <li>Player with the red kit goes first.</li>
<h3 >What do I do over and over again?</h3>
 <li>Take turns calling out squares.
 <li>Continue the loop until all sections and ships have been hit.
<h3 >When do I need to make decisions?</h3>
 <li>When it is your turn, after you hit a ship, where to hit next to take down the ship.</li>

 <h1 > Pseudocode Steps</h1>
<p>
  <li>Place your boats on your side.</li>
	<li>Once both opponents have placed boats, the player with the red kit goes first and guesses the location/square of where they think the ship is.</li>
	<li>If a ship is in that square, it is hit, if it is not, then it is not hit.</li>
	<li>Repeat until all of a player's ships are hit meaning they lost. </li>
